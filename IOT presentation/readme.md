### Project Overview

This repository contains the materials and a structured summary of a university presentation on the **opportunities and risks of Internet of Things technologies for circular business models**. The presentation examines how IoT capabilities such as **monitoring, tracking, optimization, and design evolution** can support circular economy business models described by the ReSOLVE framework. It also reviews barriers, environmental impacts, and energy saving potential associated with IoT-enabled circular business models.

**Purpose**  
- Document the presentation content in a clear, searchable format.  
- Provide a concise reference for students, instructors, and practitioners interested in IoT and circular economy intersections.  
- Highlight methodology, key findings, and practical implications for businesses and policymakers.

### Slide Summary

**Introduction and Motivation**  
- Circular business models are increasingly important for environmental performance.  
- Literature has paid limited attention to how IoT supports circular business models.  
- The presentation identifies four IoT capabilities relevant to circular business models: **monitoring, tracking, optimization, and design evolution**.

**Historical Context of IoT**  
- Brief timeline from early internet-connected devices to the coining of the term Internet of Things and the rise of RFID and sensor technologies.  
- Adoption by industry leaders and national strategies that recognize IoT as a strategic emerging technology.

**IoT Capabilities and ReSOLVE Mapping**  
- Mapping of IoT capabilities to the ReSOLVE framework elements: **Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, Exchange**.  
- Examples of how tracking and monitoring enable reuse, remanufacture, and recycling.  
- Optimization and design evolution are less explored but hold significant potential.

**Methodology Overview**  
- Systematic literature review using PRISMA principles to identify, screen, and synthesize relevant studies.  
- Use of a structured checklist to ensure reproducibility and transparency in the review process.

**Findings by Business Model Type**  
- **Optimize** and **Loop** models show the most evidence of IoT benefits, especially via monitoring and tracking.  
- **Share** and **Virtualize** models benefit from monitoring and data-driven service design.  
- **Regenerate** and **Exchange** models are less represented and need further research.

**Energy Savings and Environmental Impacts**  
- IoT-enabled circular business models show potential energy savings, with reported relative reductions in many case studies.  
- The presentation includes comparative figures showing relative energy savings across ReSOLVE categories.

**Barriers and Risks**  
- **Technical and environmental**: hardware energy consumption, e-waste, and material impacts.  
- **Security and privacy**: data protection, botnet attacks, and platform vulnerabilities.  
- **Economic and organizational**: high upfront investment, lack of standards, and unclear data ownership.  
- **Regulatory and social**: need for governance frameworks and stakeholder alignment.

**Conclusions and Outlook**  
- IoT can substantially support circular business models, particularly Optimize and Loop.  
- More research is needed on IoT’s role in Virtualize, Exchange, and Regenerate models.  
- Policy, standardization, and design-for-trust are critical to scale IoT-enabled circular solutions.

### Methodology and Frameworks

**PRISMA Based Literature Review**  
- The review follows PRISMA-style steps: define objectives, set inclusion and exclusion criteria, search databases, screen studies, extract data, and synthesize results.  
- Emphasis on transparency in search strategy and bias assessment.

**ReSOLVE Framework**  
- ReSOLVE categories used to classify business model interventions: **Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, Exchange**.  
- IoT capabilities are mapped to these categories to show where IoT contributes most to circular outcomes.

**IoT Capability Definitions**  
- **Tracking**: identity, location, and composition information for products.  
- **Monitoring**: real-time condition and environment data, alerts and notifications.  
- **Optimization**: algorithmic and control improvements for operational efficiency.  
- **Design Evolution**: feedback-driven product redesign and lifecycle improvements.

### Key Findings and Practical Implications

**Key Findings**  
- IoT most strongly supports **recycling, remanufacture, and repair** through tracking and monitoring.  
- **Optimization** yields measurable energy savings and operational improvements.  
- **Design evolution** and **virtualization** are promising but underexplored in the literature.  
- Significant barriers remain in energy consumption of IoT hardware, security, data governance, and financial investment.

**Practical Recommendations**  
- Prioritize IoT deployments that enable **real-time monitoring and tracking** to unlock reuse and remanufacturing value.  
- Integrate IoT data into product lifecycle management to inform **design for circularity**.  
- Address security and privacy from the outset and adopt standards for data ownership and interoperability.  
- Evaluate lifecycle environmental impacts of IoT hardware and pursue low-energy, recyclable device designs.
